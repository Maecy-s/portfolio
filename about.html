                        <p>I am currently a student at University of Eastern Africa, Baraton taking a Bachelors degree in Business Information Technology.</p>
                        <p>I recently joined Moringa School to persue Software Development. I do not have any work experience at the moment but I am looking foward to gaining more of it as time goes by.</p>
                        <p>I decided to join Moringa School because i always had this passion to do Softwatre Development and I realised that this is an instituition that has so many people talking great things about it's teaching methords being great.</p>
                        <p>I love nature and thus hiking is one of my hobbies.
                             I do have a few skills in networking.</p>
